![Grade image](/fractol_grade.png?raw=true)


#Overview
You can choose between some fractales the one you want to draw:

`./fractol [Mandelbrot, Julia, Newton, "Burning Ship", Croix, Fuzzy, Tetration, Glynn, JuliaBis, Lapin, Soleil, Moire]`

After that you can use +/- for increase or reduce the iteration in fractal (precision).

You can also zoom into the fractale with your mouse scroll.

You can make variation into the fractale by right click on the window and move your mouse from here.

#Installation
Just launch:
```
  git clone `the repository`
  cd Fractol
  git submodule init && git submodule update --recursive
  make
```
